> Sync your bookmarks with your selfhosted server (e.g. Nextcloud)

The goal of this project is to build a browser extension that syncs your browser data across browser vendors with the open source, self-hosted sync and share server [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com) and possibly other self-hosted solutions.

**News:** Floccus v3.1 now allows you to sync with the newly available folders in nextcloud bookmarks and also preserves the order of your bookmarks. :weight_lifting_woman:

## Install

You will need a server, at least one browser and the floccus browser extension.

You can either choose to sync via WebDAV (with any version of nextcloud or with any other WebDAV server, commercial or self-hosted).
Alternatively, if you'd like to access your bookmarks via a nice web frontend, you can sync with the nextcloud bookmarks app, which allows you to do just that. For the latter to work, you need at least version v0.11 of the Bookmarks app installed (which requires nextcloud v12 or greater).

Once you have your server ready, read on to install the browser extension.

**Note:** It is recommended to not enable native bookmark synchronization built into your browser, as it is known to cause issues.

### Chrome

You can [install it via the Chrome Web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/floccus-nextcloud-sync/fnaicdffflnofjppbagibeoednhnbjhg)

Alternatively, you can still install it by [downloading the Chrome package from the latest release](https://github.com/marcelklehr/floccus/releases/) and dropping it into Chrome's extension page.

#### Updating from v3.0 to v3.1

When using a WebDAV account, there's nothing you need to do to benefit from the new order preservation feature. If you are using the nextcloud adapter, it is recommended that you switch to the new nextcloud adapter, which works with the Bookmarks folders feature and also preserves ordering.

### Firefox

You can [install it via AMO](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/floccus/).

(Note that AMO has to review all new releases, though, so you might need to wait a bit before you can install the latest release on firefox.)

#### Updating from v2.x to v3.0

It is recommended to remove all of your bookmarks from your accounts before using the new version, deleting the accounts and then to create them again, in order to prevent unforeseen problems!

### Firefox for Android

Floccus is not supported by Firefox for Android, [yet](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/bookmarks#Browser_compatibility).

### Permissions

Floccus requests the following permissions:

| Permission           | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Unlimited web access | Necessary for accessing your self-hosted server. This cannot be limited, because everybody's server has a different URL. Unfortunately, the way webextensions work currently, floccus also gets access to all the data the browser has collected on those websites. However, floccus makes no use of that data and doesn't in any way collect information about you. |

## Usage

- **The accounts panel**; After installation the accounts pane will pop up allowing you to create and manage accounts. You will be able to access this pane at all times by clicking the floccus icon in the browser tool bar.
- **Your accounts**: You can setup multiple accounts and select a bookmark folder for each, that should be synced with that account. Floccus will keep the bookmarks in sync with the server you selected whenever you add or change them and will also sync periodically to pull the latest changes from the server.
- **Syncing the root folder**: If you want to sync all bookmarks in your browser you need to select the topmost untitled folder in the folder picker. (In case you're wondering: Syncing the root folder across browsers from different vendors is now possible out of the box, because the built-in folder names are now normalized).

### The server path: Mapping folders / Profiles

When using the nextcloud Bookmarks adapter, you can specify a 'server folder' in your floccus account setup. This is like the target folder of a copy or rsync command. While the local sync folder you have selected from your browser bookmarks will normally end up being synced to the root bookmark path on your server, you can change that to an arbitrary sub-directory, e.g. /Toolbar, with the 'server folder' setting. If you are using the WebDAV/XBEL adapter, you can do the same by specifying a specific xbel file in the settings.

This way it is possible to sync Firefox' 'Bookmarks Menu' folder to Chrome, which doesn't have a Menu folder out of the box: Simply set up a separate account for each of the main folders in firefox, each with a separate server folder, e.g.:

- Fx '/Bookmarks Toolbar' <=> '/Toolbar'
  - Fx '/Other Bookmarks' <=> '/Others'
  - Fx '/Bookmarks Menu' <=> '/Menu'

Then, in Chrome you can setup the folders as follows:

- GC '/Bookmarks Toolbar' <=> '/Toolbar'
- GC '/Bookmarks Toolbar/Menu' <=> '/Menu' (You need to create this folder yourself, of course.)
  - GC '/Other Bookmarks' <=> '/Others'

### Limitations

- Note that currently you cannot sync the same folder with multiple nextcloud accounts in order to avoid data corruption. If you sync the root folder with one account and sync a sub folder with a different account, that sub-folder will not be synced with the account connected to the root folder anymore.

### Finding duplicates

Floccus will sync your bookmarks as-is, including any dupes. If you need to find and remove duplicates in your bookmarks, try something like [bookmark-dupes](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bookmark-dupes).

## Considerations

Is this a good idea? I think so. If you'd like to know more, check out [the considerations file](./CONSIDERATIONS.md)

## What's with the name?

[Cirrus floccus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrus_floccus) is a type of cloud, that <del>can sync your browser data</del> looks very nice.
